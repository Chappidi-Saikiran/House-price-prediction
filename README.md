# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a mini machine learning application that predicts house prices based on various features using regression techniques. It was developed using Python and trained on a dataset of 42,703 properties.

## 📊 Project Description

Using the Random Forest Regressor, this model takes in features like:

- Year built  
- Stories  
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms  
- Square footage (livable and total)  
- Garage and carport info  
- Amenities (fireplace, pool, central heating/cooling)  
- Location (city and zip code)  

The model was trained and evaluated, achieving a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and is suitable for academic and learning purposes.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes 42,703 house entries with 20 attributes, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayaprakashpondy/us-house-price).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Spyder  

## 🔍 Features

- Data exploration & preprocessing  
- Visualization of skewness and feature correlation  
- Categorical encoding (e.g., city, garage_type, boolean values)  
- Sale price normalization using cube root transformation  
- Regression using Random Forest Regressor  
- Prediction interface (code-based)

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Place `ml_house_data_set.csv` in the working directory.  
3. Open and run the `.ipynb` or `.py` script in Jupyter or Spyder.  
4. Follow the script steps: preprocessing → training → prediction.
